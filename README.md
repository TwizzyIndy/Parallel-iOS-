# Parallel-iOS-Zawgyi-Unicode-Bridge

Parallel ( Zawgyi-Unicode Bridge) Cydia Substrate tweak for Jailbroken iOS Platform. With the power of Cydia Substrate(saurik), I just tried to fix the gap of Myanmar fonts which between Unicode and Zawgyi. 
I used my [**Zawgyi-Uni Identifier**](https://github.com/TwizzyIndy/Zawgyi-Uni-Identifier) library for detecting and identifying the strings whether is Unicode or Zawgyi. Many improvements I have to do.
